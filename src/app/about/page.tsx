      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm <strong>Usama</strong>, a third-year MBBS student who has decided to explore the fascinating world of technology and software development. Although I initially set out to become a doctor, my passion for AI, machine learning, and technological advancements in medicine led me to pivot towards becoming a software developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm focusing on learning and building projects in areas such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Machine Learning and AI techniques</li>
        <li>Kubernetes for container orchestration</li>
        <li>3D modeling and visualization</li>
        <li>Web development with a strong focus on TypeScript, React, and Next.js</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I believe technology has a huge role to play in revolutionizing healthcare, and I&apos;m working towards creating innovative solutions at the intersection of technology and medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continue to learn and grow in these fields, my goal is to develop meaningful applications that improve lives and bring positive change to the healthcare industry. I&apos;m always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what&apos;s possible with technology.
